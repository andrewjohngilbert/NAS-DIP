## Abstract

We present a neural architecture search (NAS) technique to enhance the performance of image de-noising, in-painting, and super-resolution tasks under the recently proposed Deep Image Prior (DIP).  We show that evolutionary search can automatically optimize the encoder-decoder (E-D) structure and meta-parameters of the DIP network, which serves as a content-specific prior to regularize these single image restoration tasks.  Our binary representation encodes the design space for an asymmetric E-D network that typically converges to yield a content-specific DIP within 10-20 generations using a population size of $500$. The optimized architectures consistently improve upon the visual quality of classical DIP for a diverse range of photographic and artistic content.
